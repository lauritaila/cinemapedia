## Project Structure (Clean Architecture Inspired)

The app follows a basic structure inspired by Clean Architecture, separating concerns into layers:

```
cinemapedia/
├── lib/
│   ├── main.dart               # Application entry point
│   ├── config/                 # Configuration files
│   │   ├── router/            # App routing configuration
│   │   └── theme/             # App theme customization
│   ├── domain/                 # Business logic layer
│   │   ├── entities/           # Core business entities
│   │   └── repositories/       # Repository interfaces
│   ├── infrastructure/         # Data layer implementation
│   │   ├── datasources/        # Remote and local data sources
│   │   ├── models/             # Data transfer objects
│   │   └── repositories/       # Repository implementations
│   └── presentation/           # UI layer
│       ├── providers/          # State management (Riverpod)
│       ├── screens/            # App screens
│       ├── widgets/            # Reusable UI components
│       └── delegates/          # Custom search delegate
├── test/                       # Test files
└── pubspec.yaml                # Project dependencies
```

### How the Layers Work Together:

1. **`Domain Layer`**: 
    - Contains business logic and entities
    - Defines repository contracts
2. **`Infrastructure Layer`**: 
    - Implements remote (The MovieDB API) and local (Isar) data sources
    - Handles data model conversions
    - Provides repository implementations
3. **`Presentation Layer`**: 
    - Manages UI components and state
    - Uses Riverpod for state management
    - Implements custom widgets and animations

---

This structure ensures a clean separation of concerns, making the app easier to maintain, test, and scale.
