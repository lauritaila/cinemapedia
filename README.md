## Project Structure (Clean Architecture Inspired)

The app follows a basic structure inspired by Clean Architecture, separating concerns into layers:

```
cinemapedia/
â”œâ”€â”€ lib/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ main.dart               # Application entry point
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ config/                 # Configuration files
â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ router/            # App routing configuration
â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ theme/             # App theme customization
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ domain/                 # Business logic layer
â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ entities/           # Core business entities
â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ repositories/       # Repository interfaces
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ infrastructure/         # Data layer implementation
â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ datasources/        # Remote and local data sources
â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ models/             # Data transfer objects
â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ repositories/       # Repository implementations
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ presentation/           # UI layer
â”‚       â”œâ”€â”€ providers/          # State management (Riverpod)
â”‚       â”œâ”€â”€ screens/            # App screens
â”‚       â”œâ”€â”€ widgets/            # Reusable UI components
â”‚       â””â”€â”€ delegates/          # Custom search delegate
â”œâ”€â”€ test/                       # Test files
â””â”€â”€ pubspec.yaml                # Project dependencies
```

### How the Layers Work Together:

1. **`Domain Layer`**: 
    - Contains business logic and entities
    - Defines repository contracts
2. **`Infrastructure Layer`**: 
    - Implements remote (The MovieDB API) and local (Isar) data sources
    - Handles data model conversions
    - Provides repository implementations
3. **`Presentation Layer`**: 
    - Manages UI components and state
    - Uses Riverpod for state management
    - Implements custom widgets and animations

This structure ensures a clean separation of concerns, making the app easier to maintain, test, and scale.
